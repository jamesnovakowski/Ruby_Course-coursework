	puts "I was walking along the beach one afternoon,
		when suddenly I saw a magic #{adj_1} buried in the sand.
		I went to pick it up, and as I did, a cloud of #{nount_1}
		came out.  When the #{noun_1} settled, #{person_1} was left
		standing on the beach.  (S)he said 'I will grant you 3 
		#{noun_2} if you can answer my riddle'

		The first riddle is: What #{verb_1} at morning, #{verb_2} at
		noon, and #{verb_3} in the evening?

		You think for a moment, and answer #{adverb_1}, 'Clearly it's 
		the #{noun_3}'

		The smile fades from #{person_1}'s face, and says 'You may not be as
		#{adj_2} as you look.  You may have your wishes, but wish wisely.'

		You think carefully, and say 'First, I would like a #{noun_4} full 
		of gold.'

		Poof, it appears before you.

		Next, you say 'I wish for the ability to #{verb_4} through #{noun_5}.
		And suddenly, you can.'

		Finally, remembering that you can never get enough of them, you say 
		'And, I would like an infinite supply of #{noun_6}.'

		#{person_1} cocks an eyebrow and says 'Are you sure?'

		You say 'Of course i'm sure! I've loved #{noun_6} all my life, and
		I never want to be without them!

		#{person_1} says 'So be it. But I must warn you, infinity is a very
		large number.'

		And so the #{noun_6} begin appearing.  At first, you're ecstatic.  You've
		wanted these ever since you saw one for the first time on your 12th 
		birthday.  And here they are!  And all for you.

		You start to get worried though, when they keep appearing. You begin
		#{verb_5} in fear when they start to appear on top of one another. Slowly
		at first, the world fills with #{noun_6}, then more quickly. They cover 
		the Earth.  They fill the Solar system, and it collapses on itself into 
		a black hole.  And yet there are more.  The mass of the black hole grows 
		and grows, and still they appear.

		Everyone is dead.  There is nothing but #{noun_6}, that keep collapsing
		into one another under the force of their own mass.  Eventually, the 
		black hole reaches the edges of the universe, and it collapses upon itself,
		consumed in the #{noun_6} singularity.  

		The moral of the story is: Keep your wishes mathematically valid.
